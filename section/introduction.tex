\section{Introduction}

(find ref for all of those)

The integration of multiple knowledge bases presents significant challenges across various applications.
Such integration may be motivated by several factors,
including the need to collaborate with diverse stakeholders who maintain their own data,
the goal of designing decentralized systems, or the ambition to develop cross-domain applications within specialized fields.

The integration of knowledges bases as multiple facets, a first one can be a problem of size, because due to size or privacy concern,
it might be possible to materialize in a single database system the knowledge bases.
In those cases paradigmn like federated querying [ref] or traversal [ref] can cope with this problem.
Another issues, is the usage of different knowledge representation or the different vocabulary in the case of \gls{kg} which is the focus of this paper.
In multiple use cases query issuer expect to be able to create their query with consideration for single knowledge representation.
