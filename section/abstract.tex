The integration of heterogeneous knowledge bases expressed using different representations remains a key challenge across many applications.
In decentralized environments, where discovery queries must be executed over distributed and unindexed data sources, identifying and applying alignment rules becomes particularly difficult.
These rules are needed to enable users to query data using a single, unified representation.
In this demo paper, we introduce our approach to online schema alignment and demonstrate its integration into a \glsentrylong{ltqp} engine.
Through a social media scenario, we demonstrate how users can query networks where similar information is expressed using different vocabularies.
The accompanying web-based interface provides an intuitive and user-friendly environment for exploring such networks and executing queries seamlessly across heterogeneous schemas.
We also provide the source code of the demonstrator, together with a library and a command-line interface that enable the integration of our engine into other applications.
