\section{Conclusion}
In this demo paper, we present a system for online schema alignment that employs a vocabulary inspired by the \gls{sssom} specification~\cite{sssom_website, matentzoglu2022simple}.
Through this demonstration, we show that, in unindexed and decentralized networks, \gls{ltqp} queries can be executed successfully in a generalized manner without increasing the complexity of the user-issued queries.
Future work includes extending the system to support more advanced reasoning mechanisms, such as the SPARQL entailment regimes~\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-entailment/}} and Notation3~\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html}}.
Engines such as the EYE reasoner~\cite{n3Verborgh, WrightN3} or modern Prolog implementations like Scryer Prolog~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog}} could enable such reasoning capabilities in a streaming context.
