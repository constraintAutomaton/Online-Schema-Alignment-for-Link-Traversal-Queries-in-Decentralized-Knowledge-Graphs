  year      = {2023},
  abstract  = {To counter societal and economic problems caused by data silos on the Web, efforts such as Solid strive to reclaim private data by storing it in permissioned documents over a large number of personal vaults across the Web. Building applications on top of such a decentralized Knowledge Graph involves significant technical challenges: centralized aggregation prior to query processing is impossible for legal reasons, and current federated querying techniques cannot handle this large scale of distribution at the expected performance. We propose an extension to Link Traversal Query Processing (LTQP) that incorporates structural properties within decentralized environments to tackle their unprecedented scale. In this article, we analyze the structural properties of the Solid decentralization ecosystem that are relevant for query execution, we introduce novel LTQP algorithms leveraging these structural properties, and evaluate their effectiveness. Our experiments indicate that these new algorithms obtain correct results in the order of seconds, which existing algorithms cannot achieve. This work reveals that a traversal-based querying method using structural assumptions can be effective for large-scale decentralization, but that advances are needed in the area of query planning for LTQP to handle more complex queries. These insights open the door to query-driven decentralized applications, in which declarative queries shield developers from the inherent complexity of a decentralized landscape.},

  abstract     = {Query execution over the Web of Linked Data has attracted much attention recently. A particularly interesting approach is link traversal based query execution which proposes to integrate the traversal of data links into the creation of query results. Hence -in contrast to traditional query execution paradigms- this does not assume a fixed set of relevant data sources beforehand; instead, the traversal process discovers data and data sources on the fly and, thus, enables applications to tap the full potential of the Web.While several authors have studied possibilities to implement the idea of link traversal based query execution and to optimize query execution in this context, no work exists that discusses theoretical foundations of the approach in general. Our paper fills this gap.We introduce a well-defined semantics for queries that may be executed using a link traversal based approach. Based on this semantics we formally analyze properties of such queries. In particular, we study the computability of queries as well as the implications of querying a potentially infinite Web of Linked Data. Our results show that query computation in general is not guaranteed to terminate and that for any given query it is undecidable whether the execution terminates. Furthermore, we define an abstract execution model that captures the integration of link traversal into the query execution process. Based on this model we prove the soundness and completeness of link traversal based query execution and analyze an existing implementation approach.},

The view definitions can be in SQL or Datalog, and may use UNION, negation, aggregation (e.g. SUM, MIN), linear recursion, and general recursion.We first present a counting algorithm that tracks the number of alternative derivations (counts) for each derived tuple in a view. The algorithm works with both set and duplicate semantics. We present the algorithm for nonrecursive views (with negation and aggregation), and show that the count for a tuple can be computed at little or no cost above the cost of deriving the tuple. The algorithm is optimal in that it computes exactly those view tuples that are inserted or deleted. Note that we store only the number of derivations, not the derivations themselves.We then present the Delete and Rederive algorithm, DRed, for incremental maintenance of recursive views (negation and aggregation are permitted). The algorithm works by first deleting a superset of the tuples that need to be deleted, and then rederiving some of them. The algorithm can also be used when the view definition is itself altered.},

  abstract  = {The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud is rapidly becoming the largest interconnected source of structured data on diverse domains.The potential of the LOD cloud is enormous, ranging from solving challenging AI issues such as open domain question answering to automated knowledge discovery. However, due to an inherent distributed nature of LOD and a growing number of ontologies and vocabularies used in LOD datasets, querying over multiple datasets and retrieving LOD data remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to querying linked data by using alignments for processing queries whose constituent data come from heterogeneous sources. We also report on our Alignment based Linked Open Data Querying System (ALOQUS) and present the architecture and associated methods. Using the state of the art alignment system BLOOMS, ALOQUS automatically maps concepts in users' SPARQL queries, written in terms of a conceptual upper ontology or domain specific ontology, to different LOD concepts and datasets. It then creates a query plan, sends sub-queries to the different endpoints, crawls for co-referent URIs, merges the results and presents them to the user. We also compare the existing querying systems and demonstrate the added capabilities that the alignment based approach can provide for querying the Linked data.},

Whereas the subsumption problem in FL0 becomes already intractable in the presence of acyclic TBoxes, it remains tractable in EL even with general concept inclusion axioms (GCIs). On the one hand, we extend the positive result for EL by identifying a set of expressive means that can be added to EL without sacrificing tractability. On the other hand, we show that basically all other additions of typical DL constructors to EL with GCIs make subsumption intractable, and in most cases even EXPTIME-complete. In addition, we show that subsumption in FL0 with GCIs is EXPTIME-complete.},
