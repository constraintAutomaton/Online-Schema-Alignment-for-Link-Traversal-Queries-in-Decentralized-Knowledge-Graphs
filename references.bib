  abstract  = {We present incremental evaluation algorithms to compute changes to materialized views in relational and deductive database systems, in response to changes (insertions, deletions, and updates) to the relations. The view definitions can be in SQL or Datalog, and may use UNION, negation, aggregation (e.g. SUM, MIN), linear recursion, and general recursion.We first present a counting algorithm that tracks the number of alternative derivations (counts) for each derived tuple in a view. The algorithm works with both set and duplicate semantics. We present the algorithm for nonrecursive views (with negation and aggregation), and show that the count for a tuple can be computed at little or no cost above the cost of deriving the tuple. The algorithm is optimal in that it computes exactly those view tuples that are inserted or deleted. Note that we store only the number of derivations, not the derivations themselves.We then present the Delete and Rederive algorithm, DRed, for incremental maintenance of recursive views (negation and aggregation are permitted). The algorithm works by first deleting a superset of the tuples that need to be deleted, and then rederiving some of them. The algorithm can also be used when the view definition is itself altered.},

  abstract  = {The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud is rapidly becoming the largest interconnected source of structured data on diverse domains.The potential of the LOD cloud is enormous, ranging from solving challenging AI issues such as open domain question answering to automated knowledge discovery. However, due to an inherent distributed nature of LOD and a growing number of ontologies and vocabularies used in LOD datasets, querying over multiple datasets and retrieving LOD data remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to querying linked data by using alignments for processing queries whose constituent data come from heterogeneous sources. We also report on our Alignment based Linked Open Data Querying System (ALOQUS) and present the architecture and associated methods. Using the state of the art alignment system BLOOMS, ALOQUS automatically maps concepts in users' SPARQL queries, written in terms of a conceptual upper ontology or domain specific ontology, to different LOD concepts and datasets. It then creates a query plan, sends sub-queries to the different endpoints, crawls for co-referent URIs, merges the results and presents them to the user. We also compare the existing querying systems and demonstrate the added capabilities that the alignment based approach can provide for querying the Linked data.},

  abstract  = {Recently, it has been shown that the small description logic (DL) EL, which allows for conjunction and existential restrictions, has better algorithmic properties than its counterpart FL0, which allows for conjunction and value restrictions. Whereas the subsumption problem in FL0 becomes already intractable in the presence of acyclic TBoxes, it remains tractable in EL even with general concept inclusion axioms (GCIs). On the one hand, we extend the positive result for EL by identifying a set of expressive means that can be added to EL without sacrificing tractability. On the other hand, we show that basically all other additions of typical DL constructors to EL with GCIs make subsumption intractable, and in most cases even EXPTIME-complete. In addition, we show that subsumption in FL0 with GCIs is EXPTIME-complete.},
